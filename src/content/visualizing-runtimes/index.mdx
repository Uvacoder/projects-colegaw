In May of 2021, I wrote an article (and created a corresponding [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/chroline/visualizingRuntimes/blob/main/Visualizing%20Algorithm%20Runtimes%20in%20Python.ipynbs)) that details how you can use Python to visualize and determine runtime complexities for different algorithms. I wrote this article after the completion of the CS331 course from which I learned how to determine runtime complexities of more complex algorithms by using experimentation and practical theory. This article was written as a demonstration of my knowledge gained from this course.

The article was published on [BetterProgramming](https://betterprogramming.pub), one of Medium's largest programming publications for whom I am a regular contributing writer. To read the article, visit [my post on BetterProgramming](https://betterprogramming.pub/3-algorithm-runtimes-visualized-with-python-e51441827917?source=friends_link&sk=ae48d884efebad21e745d50a4cf519e8) or [my post on dev.to](https://dev.to/chroline/visualizing-algorithm-runtimes-in-python-f92).
