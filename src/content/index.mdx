This is a repository of all of the projects I have done and currently working on. Hopefully they will peak your interest! I invite you to check out the code that powers these projects, as many of them are open-sourced and hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/chroline) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/chroline).
