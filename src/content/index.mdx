This is a repository of all of the projects I have done and currently working on. Hopefully they will peak your interest! I invite you to check out the code that powers these projects, as many of them are open-sourced and hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/chroline) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/chroline).

**Sadly, not all projects can have an incredibly long lifespan. However, I do think that these projects have served as great learning moments and opportunities for me to grow as a person and as a developer. For that reason I have decided to keep an archive of my past projects that are no longer active.**
