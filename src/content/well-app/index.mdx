# What is the Well app?

**Problem statement**

</ToggleTitle>

<ToggleContent>

It's an understatement to say that many students and even adults feel the overwhelming pressure to perform and achieve highly in our society. This leads to feelings of anxiety, stress, and of course, burn out. In turn, these emotions negatively affect our productivity and overall happiness. This evidently creates a feedback loop wherein we are unable to be productive and escape burn out.

How can we fix this pressing issue? Unsurprisingly, there has been research into how we can do so.Â [Research](/well-app/research)Â has shown that daily reflection increases our wellbeing and state of mind. This only involves small, simple activities that challenge you to reflect on your day. Where we come along is compiling these small activities into a friendly interface that will help people to make a positive impact on their wellbeing.

The Well app is a mental health and mindfulness app built on top of the science of positive psychology. The Well app is more than just another meditation or journaling app; it encourages you to enhance and reflect on your day with structured, guided activities. 

There are 5 daily tasks that the Well app asks you to complete each day: record 3 gratitudes, write a journal entry, perform 3 acts of kindness, exercise for 20 minutes, and meditate for 15 minutes.

# The 21-day sprint

The Well app works best when its users use it continually for 21 days. Why 21 days? The inspiration behind this comes from positive psychology advocate Shawn Achor,Â whose [work](/well-app/research)Â found that in only 21 days, you can rewire your brain to think more optimistically, which will increase your happiness and productivity.

# Benefits of using the Well app

Once you get into a habit of completing your tasks and activities for each day, you might notice changes to your mindset, happiness, productivity, and overall wellbeing. The activities included in the Well app are purposefully designed to guide your brain into thinking more positively, which can improve many aspects of your life without you even realizing!
